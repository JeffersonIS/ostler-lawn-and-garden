          <p className="about-description">
            We started mowing with our siblings in 2007 to make money for church missions and college. Now it's just Jefferson & Benson.
          </p>
          <p className="about-description">
            We took a break for a bit to go to serve those missions, go to college, and start families...but now we're back! And we've mowed hundreds of Tri-Cities lawns.
          </p>
          <p className="about-description">
            We're a small but mighty operation making the Tri Cities beautiful one lawn at a time.
